# Glow Blinds Card

🇬🇧 English · 🇳🇱 [Nederlands](blinds.nl.md)

A Home Assistant dashboard card that shows your roller blinds the way they actually hang: vertically, inside a window.

## Features

- **Drag** inside a window to send the blind to a position. A dashed line and a label show live where you are dragging to.
- **Live position**: the percentage and the fabric follow `current_position` while the motor runs. Integrations that report the target position straight away (optimistically) no longer make the blind jump back and forth.
- **Stop button** per blind. It lights up while the blind is moving, also for motors that don't report `opening`/`closing`.
- **Open all / close all** with two buttons at the top.
- **Sky behind the window** that follows the weather (sun, clouds, rain, thunderstorm, snow, fog) and the time of day (day, twilight, night). One sun or moon for the whole card.
- **Your own colour per blind**, with a glow in that colour.
- **Fabric type** per blind: dimout (partly darkening) or blackout.
- **As many blinds as you like**, spread over columns automatically.
- **Visual editor**: set everything up without YAML.
- **Six languages**: English, Dutch, French, German, Spanish and Italian, picked automatically from your Home Assistant language.
- Keyboard support (arrow up/down, Home, End).

| `name` | Name below the window. Defaults to the entity name. |
| `color` | Colour of the fabric and glow, e.g. `"#8FE3B8"`. |
| `fabric` | `dimout` = partly darkening (you can still see the sky through the fabric), `blackout` = fully darkening. |
| `travel_time` | Seconds the blind needs from fully open to fully closed (default 30). Used to estimate movement for motors that don't report it. |
| `invert` | `true` if your blind reports 0 = open and 100 = closed. |

A blind that can't set a position (open/close only) opens fully when released above the middle and closes fully below it.
